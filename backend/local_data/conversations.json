It's okay to feel this way; anxiety is a tough visitor sometimes.  Let's gently work together to help you feel a little more grounded and calm.\n\nTell me, what specifically is making you feel anxious right now?  There's no pressure to share if you don't feel comfortable, but sometimes just naming it can help.  Even if it's just a general feeling, that's perfectly fine.\n\nIn the meantime, perhaps we can try a simple grounding technique.  Could you try noticing five things you can see around you?  Take your time with each one, really observing the details.  Then, four things you can touch – maybe the texture of your clothing, or the surface of a table. Then three things you can hear. Two things you can smell, and finally, one thing you can taste.\n\nThis might seem small, but bringing your awareness to your senses can help pull you back into the present moment, away from the anxious thoughts that might be swirling around.  We can explore other techniques too, if this one doesn't quite feel right for you.  Just let me know what feels comfortable.  I'm here with you, and I want you to know you're safe.",
